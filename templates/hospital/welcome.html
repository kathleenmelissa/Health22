            <h3>Cardiac Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Cardiac monitoring generally refers to continuous or intermittent monitoring of heart activity to assess a patient's condition relative to their cardiac rhythm. Cardiac monitoring is usually carried out using electrocardiography, which is a noninvasive process that records the heart's electrical activity and displays it in an electrocardiogram.[1] It is different from hemodynamic monitoring, which monitors the pressure and flow of blood within the cardiovascular system. The two may be performed simultaneously on critical heart patients. Cardiac monitoring for ambulatory patients (those well enough to walk around) is known as ambulatory electrocardiography and uses a small, wearable device, such as a Holter monitor, wireless ambulatory ECG, or an implantable loop recorder. Data from a cardiac monitor can be transmitted to a distant monitoring station in a process known as telemetry or biotelemetry. .</p>

            <h3>First Aid</h3>
            <p>First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health,while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD.</p>

                <p> <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> While the majority hospitals have experienced surgeons on staff, they rarely have specialists in every surgical area of expertise [18]. Frequently, they will seek the advice of doctors with specific knowledge. Video and audio have been used by experts in specialized medical specialties to assist the surgical team throughout the procedure.

As medical technology progresses, many and more surgeries are reliant on it. A little surgical microscope, for example, can be put into the body and, with the help of a high-definition 4 K monitor like the Olympus Visera, vividly depict the specifics of the area to be operated on. </p>

                <p> <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i> One of the earliest validation studies relates to the minimally-invasive VR simulator for laparoscopic surgery (MIST VR) [Taffinder et al., 1998]. They defined a score for various aspects of psychomotor skill and conducted two studies related to the simulator: the first study assesses surgeons of different surgical experience to validate the scoring system and the second study investigates the effect of a standard laparoscopic surgery training course. Experienced surgeons (more than 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies) were significantly more efficient, made less correctional submovements and completed the tasks faster than trainee surgeons. Thus, the construct validity was high. The training course caused an improvement in efficiency and a reduction in errors for trainee surgeons. </p>
